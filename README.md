# Dotfiles

This is the repository with some of my personal dotfiles, it currently includes:
- i3wm
- polybar
- tmux
- zshrc
- alacritty
- btop
- picom
- rofi
- tmux-powerline
- lunarvim

Aesthetic wise it mostly follows the _tokyonight-storm_ theme.
They're not anything special at all, and I intend to move from i3 to hyprland in the next few months.
